<h1>The best web series according to Prachi</h1>
<h2>My top 3 web series of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Clone Wars</h3>
<p>It is the best web series out there. It has the best plot and everything is just perfect. Also, it is not a kid's show.</p>
<h3>The Mandalorian</h3>
<p>The Mando and the kid make the best duo. No words to describe how awesome and wholesome it is.</p>
<h3>The Bad Batch</h3>
<p>It is kinda sequel to The Clone Wars but is not as good as The Clone Wars.</p>
